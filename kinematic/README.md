# Kinematics

This is the prototype version and inspiration that led to the Lie Theory based optimation solver. These tests are conducted on a 3-DoF robot that has a linear rail for the first actuated joint followed by two linkages with two acutated revolute joints. The entire robot is planar to simplify the kinematics for the original proof of concept.

Run `sim_main.m` to use the previous kinematic based optimization solver (without the PID controller).
